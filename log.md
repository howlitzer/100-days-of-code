# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 7, 2016


**Today's Progress**: Finally forked this for my own and trying to learn how to use GitHub better to keep this updated. As well I completed the Javascript section in the Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 - Udemy and made the little reaction timer game. 

**Thoughts:** I found myself struggling with the bonfire challenges on FCC in the basic algorithm section so I have decided to take a step back and relearn my JS, I started readin the YDKJS books and I am about half way through the 2nd one, Scopes and Closures

Ive kept my log from the previous days on twitter so be sure to check out where I started, and follow along to see where im going
