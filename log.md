# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 8, 2016


**Today's Progress**: Got through 3 bonfire challenges in the Basic Algorithm Scripting Free Code Camp section

**Thoughts:** I am quite proud of myself, after struggling when I started these challenges I decided to take a step back and do some further learning and reading and although not complete I decided to give it another go and really suprised myself! I started to understand what I was doing a lot more and was able to learn from trial and error of what was working and what wasnt. I spent about 45-60min on each one which I was suprised as well, hoping to finish that section by the end of next week.


### Day 5: January 7, 2016


**Today's Progress**: Finally forked this for my own and trying to learn how to use GitHub better to keep this updated. As well I completed the Javascript section in the Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 - Udemy and made the little reaction timer game. 

**Thoughts:** I found myself struggling with the bonfire challenges on FCC in the basic algorithm section so I have decided to take a step back and relearn my JS, I started readin the YDKJS books and I am about half way through the 2nd one, Scopes and Closures

Ive kept my log from the previous days on twitter so be sure to check out where I started, and follow along to see where im going
